        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko).
             They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste.
             Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.
